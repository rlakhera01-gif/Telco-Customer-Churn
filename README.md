# Telco-Customer-Churn
End-to-end ML project for predicting telecom customer churn with business-focused evaluation metrics

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project develops a machine learning pipeline to identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive and data-driven retention strategies.
